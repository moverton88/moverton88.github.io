    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a scientist and educator dedicated to making scientific ideas accessible, engaging, and relevant to learners from all backgrounds. 
      My teaching emphasizes academic empowerment, conceptual and social connection-building, and the holistic development of both students and communities.
      My research integrates experimental and computational approaches to explore genomic variation, gene regulation, and microbial physiology.

    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>
      Over nine years of experience teaching and mentoring in biology, including leading lab sections, designing curriculum, and fostering inclusive learning environments.
      I have taught courses in molecular biology, population genetics, microbiology, and bioinformatics at both UC San Diego and Cal Poly Pomona.

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      My PhD research focused on the genetic and physiological basis of mutation-driven processes in yeast using whole-genome sequencing, CRISPR-based engineering, and custom bioinformatics pipelines.
      I also published a review on archaeal viruses during my master's program and am passionate about connecting data science with molecular biology.
