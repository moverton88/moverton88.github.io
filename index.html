    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a scientist and educator dedicated to making scientific ideas accessible, engaging, and relevant to learners from all backgrounds. 
      My teaching emphasizes academic empowerment, conceptual and social connection-building, and the holistic development of both students and communities.
      My research integrates experimental and computational approaches to explore mutational processes, microbial physiology, and fitness landscapes.

    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>
      I have been teaching and mentoring in biology for over nine years, across lecture, lab, and discussion formats.
      I have taught courses in molecular biology, population genetics, microbiology, and bioinformatics at both UC San Diego and Cal Poly Pomona.
      I have an established history of designing engaging curricula, leading inquiry-based and active learning modalities, and fostering inclusive learning environments.

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      My PhD research focused on the origin and physiological effects of mutations in yeast. For my dissertation, I investigated the potential
      mutagenic effects of a CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive element when carried over evolutionary timescales. In this system, off-target cutting of the
      Cas9 element was detected from the genome repair processes, which generate loss of heterozygosity events. I found that current methods for
      LOH detection to be problematic, so I developed an improved computational pipeline to detect and analyze LOH events from short-read sequencing. 
      I then applied this pipeline to multiple public datasets to reveal the genetic factors important for LOH rate variation in the yeast clade. 
      Additionally, I investigated the physiological effects of mutations in yeast by reanalyzing whole-transcriptome measurements in gene deletion
      mutants under a simple resource partitioning model.
    <p>
      During my master's program, I investigated the evolutionary history and replication cycle of the extremophilic archaeal virus Sulfolobus Turreted
      Icosahedral Virus. From this work, I published a review on recent discoveries using this virus as a model system and its relevance to basic and medical sciences.
