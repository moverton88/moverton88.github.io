    <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I have over nine years of experience teaching and mentoring students across multiple institutions, 
      including UC San Diego and Cal Poly Pomona. As a Teaching Assistant, Teaching Associate, and Research Mentor, 
      I have led lab and discussion sections in courses such as introductory biology, molecular biology, bioinformatics, 
      and population genetics. I’ve developed and delivered course materials, supported students through active learning, 
      and created inclusive, student-centered lab environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      My teaching roles have included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Leading lab sections in molecular methods, bioinformatics, and recombinant DNA techniques</li>
      <li>Redesigning an introductory biology lab for improved clarity and engagement</li>
      <li>Mentoring over 15 students through independent research projects</li>
      <li>Collaborating with diverse instructional teams and adapting teaching through remote learning transitions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      My teaching is grounded in academic empowerment, intellectual rigor, and holistic student development. I strive to create 
      an environment where students feel supported, challenged, and inspired to ask questions that matter to them. I believe 
      science education should foster curiosity, collaboration, and a sense of belonging—especially for students from backgrounds 
      historically underrepresented in STEM.
    </p>
    <p>
      I incorporate active learning strategies, peer support, and inclusive pedagogy to make complex biological concepts accessible 
      and engaging. Whether I am guiding students through PCR troubleshooting or facilitating critical discussions about gene drives, my 
      goal is always to help them grow as thinkers, learners, and scientists.
